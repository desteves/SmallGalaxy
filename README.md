Abstract:

There are many mobile games already available on the iPhone and
Android markets, but very few that deliver an engaging augmented reality
experience, building upon reality to create a compelling experience. For
example, what if there were a game that encouraged people to get up and
explore their neighborhood and take a walk, while also offering an
interesting gamified experience? We created such a game, a geospatial
game in which the player, explores a small region of their local area in
order to send invaders out into a small galaxy of randomly generated
planets. It takes a while for their adorable invaders to arrive at planets, and
they can only fire one at a time. Players must also figure out the optimal
path through the area so that they can capture each planet before their
time runs out. So hurry up, and see if you can conquer your
neighborhood’s galaxy!

Small Galaxy delivers a pocket-sized dose of intergalactic adventure.
Play sessions are designed to be brief frenetic adventures that combine the
exploratory aspects of geo-tagging, and the engagement of mobile
gaming. Players are challenged to capture each planet in their galactic
neighborhood before the last of their captured planets fights off the
player’s invaders. It’s a race against time as players choose their targets,
carefully manage their invaders, and sprint to their next objective.
Game flow
1. Players begin by selecting one of two ‘galaxies’:
a. "The Milky way", a small one neighborhood map.
b. "Andromeda", an expansive map the size of a college
campus.
2. Once the session begins the game randomly generates five
planets within the selected galaxy. These planets are displayed
on the map.
3. Players may send an invader from their location to the nearest
planet:
a. Careful! Invaders always begin their journey from the
players current location, and they may only have one
invader on screen at a time.
b. Invaders are the only way to capture planets, so players
will need think about the best places to launch them
from.
4. Captured planets earn the player points, however the planet
natives will fight off the invaders in roughly two minutes after
they were first captured.
a. Players must have each planet captured at the same
time to win.
b. Once players capture their first planet, if they are ever
reduced to zero captured planets they lose.
5. Each round is designed to be winnable, however current
environmental conditions and personal ability may result in
variable levels of difficulty. In this way Small Galaxy is similar
to solitaire, and hopefully as addicting.
